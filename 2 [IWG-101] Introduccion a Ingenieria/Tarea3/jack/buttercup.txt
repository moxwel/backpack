Forget it, I'll do it sometime, ooh
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far, oh!
Fine, electrify mine, oh
Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at your eyes
Without sparking some
Electrify my heart
Electrify my heart
Surprise, I'm in the same time
Beneath the same sun
(Oh, yeah)
Oh man you cut me to size
My little buttercup
(That hurt!)
Fine, electrify mine
Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at those eyes
Without sparking some
Electrify my heart
Electrify my heart
Electrify my heart
Electrify my heart
