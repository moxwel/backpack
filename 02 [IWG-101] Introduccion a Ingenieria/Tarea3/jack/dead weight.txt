I love what I can't see
What's expected of you, what's expected of me?
Now it's quarter to three
Let it all get away
Oh, what the hell can I do?
To fill the pages?
Meet the strangers?
Kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages?
A time or two
But it's all so good
To let up
Dead weight (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (I'm falling around and around) (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (I'm falling around and around) (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Got everything I need (Haha, yeah!)
Clothes on my back
The wind on my teeth
What I control is in me
There's more wood to burn
Oh, what the hell can I do?
To fill the pages? (The pages)
Meet the strangers? (The strangers)
Kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages?
A ride or two
But I fall so good
When I go, heh!
Dead weight (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (I'm falling around and around) (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (I'm falling around and around) (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (I'm falling around and around) (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
Dead weight (I'm falling around and around) (Dead weight)
Dead weight, yeah
