We can make it fun
Out the blood
Lock the door
You can drop "I'm fine"
Into the mind, but
Look before
I'm only here because of reason
I close my eyes there goes a season
I will bury all my best friends
As I carry all the questions
End
In the middle of my heart and my life
'Cause we're
Already out this far
Holy one
End
In the middle of my heart and my life
'Cause we're
Already out this far
Holy one
Although the monster's in his cave
If we keep quiet we'll be safe
Take your lovey rope and wrap around my brain
Until the muscles ache and strain
I'll be happy on the day I squish the bug
That sucks my blood and has me drugged
Swallow all of my teeth and shut the blinds
I can do another 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more times
Look at my tongue
Look how I'm young
Check out the spread
Look at my face
I can replace
Every space
Don't think I won't
Looking for heart
Not looking hard
Walking on air
Start up the car
Know where you are
Walking on air
Contest my
My inside
Make me find
Harder time
Contest my
My inside
Make me find
